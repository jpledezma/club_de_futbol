After git is installed, open Command Prompt and run 
npm config set script-shell "C:\Program Files\Git\bin\bash.exe"
This will force all npm scripts to run within the Git Bash standalone shell rather instead
of using the default Windows configuration, allowing you to now run npm scripts containing
Bash within a Windows environment.
